### Context
This was project 2 of CISC361 at University of Delaware, the largest of the semester.<br>
Lolshell is an incredibly basic Unix shell, written in C.

Development was performed with Visual Studio Code under the fabulous Linux Subsystem for Windows.

It lacks most of the features that real shells have, such as pipes and command history. &nbsp;These were deemed to be outside the scope of the class by our instructor. &nbsp;This said however, it still contains enough substance to navigate the Unix filesystem and run basic commands.

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/Fasteroid/lolshell/releases) for a full description of what it can do.
